# turtle-exploration
Exploring the Turtle library for Haskell shell scripting

The code in `src/Main.hs` contains my results of the [hackathon on Feb. 17, 2016](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Haskell-Users-Group/events/228137734)

The intention here is to see how well Turtle can perform the typical Bash chores familiar to casual users.
